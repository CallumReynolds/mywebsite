                        I've always wanted a career in Information Technology, no other industry fields sparked any interest as much as IT has.
                        The technology world amazes me to no end, seeing all the highly sophisticated things people create just gets me wondering
                        how on earth did they do that! This is one of the great insights of IT, there are so many resources available online 
                        to research and find out about.

                    <p>
                        My journey to get into IT started off with attempting to get into Game Development at QUT because I have a deep love
                        and admiration for video games. Turns out the uni life wasn't right for me and so I ended up deferring with not much idea
                        off what I was going to do.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        After a while of...nothing...I finally decided to bite the bullet and try studying again but instead, I'd go to a more
                        easygoing environment which was TAFE. I ended up studying at TAFE Southbank doing a Certificate III in Information Technology
                        (Networking). At first it was tough for me to get into the groove of things but I eventually got a routine going and I
                        ended up completing the course. My next step was to go onto study the Diploma of Networking which sadly didn't go to plan
                        and I ended up deferring and leaving the course due to personal reasons.

                        Now I was back to square one and not sure where to go from here, I spent a while thinking and trying to sort out my life
                        and ended up doing part time work with my uncle doing cleaning while I try and figure out what I want to do exactly. After working
                        for my uncle for a while I decided to try and study again, with an intent of learning programming. I tried to learn Html, Css and JavaScript
                        by myself but didn't get very far. Even though I was unable to program very well I felt a burning passion inside and desire
                        to pursue coding. I eventually decided to enroll in the Diploma of Software Development at TAFE and see if I could make
                        something of this programming passion. I was concerned that my past personal issues would get in the way again and stop
                        me from continuing my studies. After forcing myself to face my troubles I managed to push through and complete the course(I've 
                        received satisfactory results for all my units just waiting for eveything to be processed).

                        I plan on to continue my studies by learning new technologies through online courses and to work on some personal
                        projects to build up my portfolio!
