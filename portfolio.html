                    During my mid semester TAFE break, I decided to partake in the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp</a> 
                    by Angela Yu on Udemy which I have since then completed. While progressing through the course, one of my TAFE teachers sent out an email
                    with an optional task to complete, which involved: fixing up a matching pair game in Java. I decided to instead, make my own Matching Pairs Game 
                    using my newly acquired skills. I've got the game source code on my <a href="https://github.com/CallumReynolds">github</a> and hosted on <a href="https://callumreynolds.github.io/MatchingPairs/">github pages</a>.

                    I stumbled across Jekyll while looking at hosting websites. The idea of being able to host a website with data without
                    requiring a database sounded like a niche way of developing a site. Using a Windows computer made it a little bit of a difficult
                    process because Jekyll requires Ruby which isn't supported well on Windows. Eventually with enough tinkering I was able to
                    get the very basics of the Jekyll site up and running and can be previewed <a href="https://callumreynolds.github.io/">here</a>.

            <p>These are some of the applications that I had to create for my tafe assessments!</p>
            <div class="center-div">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tool Rental Web App</strong> - ASP.NET MVC web application which communicates with a RESTful API to 
                        enable the tracking and rentals of tools. Features systems to handle customers, tools and rentals(hiring and returning)
                        tools. Also includes reports and history of transactions which can be exported to a csv file. 
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>'Quick Quiz'</strong> - Java inter-processing communication system that delivers quiz questions via a classroom-based
                            network to a group of students. Uses a chat server which the teacher and students connect to, the teacher has a seperate form
                            to the students. The teacher has a list of questions to choose from and send to the students which they send there answers back
                            for the teacher to review. Built using advanced data structures including: doubly linked lists and binary trees.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>'Xeno Onslaught'</strong> - a mobile game built using the LOVE 2d engine which can handle game states.
                        A simple game which involves a player facing off an endless wave of aliens and tries to survive for as long as possible.
                        Has settings to change game options and a scoreboard which keeps track of player scores.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tool Rental Windows App</strong> - very similar functionality to the tool rental web app because they are
                        both based off the same scenario. Created as a windows form application using SQLite and Dapper for data handling.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>'Ian's Industrial Installation'</strong> - java form application with the main focus of handling 
                        2d arrays. It worked by reading in CSV files with formatted data and displaying the corresponding data in 
                        grid view. Different files could be read in and exported out as well.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>'Birthday Tracker'</strong> - a very simple java form application which tracked certain information About
                        people such as birthday, likes and dislikes. Used simple data structures and had features for sorting and navigation.
                    </li>
